# HipChat emoticons

A Sinatra app running on Heroku.

See it here: <http://hipchat-emoticons.nyh.name>

## Noticed an unlisted emoticon?

There is an update script to update the emoticon set. The process is semi-manual, so I run it about once a week.

If you notice new emoticons, feel free to [create a GitHub *issue*](https://github.com/henrik/hipchat-emoticons/issues/new) or [ping me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/henrik) and I'll probably update sooner.

*Pull requests* for new emoticons aren't necessary since I'll just use the update script.

Pull requests for other things are of course very welcome.


## Want to request a new emoticon?

This site just lists the emoticons that HipChat supports. Contact them if you want to suggest additions.

Or you can [upload custom emoticons](https://hipchat.com/admin/emoticons) that only work on your account.


## Running locally

Make sure you're running Ruby 1.9 or better.

    bundle install
    rackup
    open http://localhost:9292


## Updating emoticons.json

Run `rake`. This will update `emoticons.json`. Commit and push.
