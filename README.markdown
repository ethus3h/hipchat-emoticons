# HipChat emoticons

This was a Sinatra app on <http://hipchat-emoticons.nyh.name> listing [HipChat](http://hipchat.com) emoticons.

They have since added their own site, so now the site is deprecated and redirects to theirs.

If you want a code example of how to retrieve their emoticon list with Ruby, feel free to look at older versions of this code.


## Want to request a new emoticon?

This site just lists the emoticons that HipChat supports. Contact them if you want to suggest additions.

Or you can [upload custom emoticons](https://hipchat.com/admin/emoticons) that only work on your account.
